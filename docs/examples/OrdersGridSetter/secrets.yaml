# How to create Tinkoff API token: https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/token/
# After creating token, store it to `userToken` variable or in `TKS_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

# You can find `accountId` number with command: `tksbrokerapi --accounts` and then store it to `userAccount` variable
# or in `TKS_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable.

# Broker account:
userName: "John Doe"  # Your name to identify in log.
userToken: ""  # Place here api-token (`t.*****`). Or stay it empty and use `TKS_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
userAccount: ""  # Place here `accountId` number. Or stay it empty and use `TKS_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable.
comment: "Test account"  # Some additional comment to identify in log. Can be empty.
